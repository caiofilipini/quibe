# Quibe

Quibe is a weird learning experiment. It's supposed to be a na√Øve implementation of an in-memory message broker.
It is written in [Go](https://golang.org) and implements (well, will do at some point) its own communication protocol.

## Why "quibe"?

Most message brokers have the letter "Q" in their names, for obvious reasons. I thought "Quibe" was a good choice for an experiment. Plus, it sounds funny.

Quibe is the Portuguese word for [Kibbeh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbeh), a Middle Eastern dish that is very famous in Brazil.

## What Quibe is

Quibe is a learning experiment.

## What Quibe is not

Quibe is not production ready, and it probably will never be.
